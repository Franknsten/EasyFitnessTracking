# EasyFitnessTracking
A simple way to track your workouts and weight, keep progress pics, daily steps and stretching, and even manage spending.

## Why
I spent a while trying to find an app or website that lets me track workouts/weight, progress photos, and other things. All the ones I found were too restrictive or expensive, and didn't cover all the things I wanted to have it do. So I figured I'd make this. It's still in active development, so please bear with me through changes, and feel free to give feedback, submit bugs, and contribute.


## Features
1. Workouts
  Workouts work on an AB alternating cycle. Drag and drop to reorder a workout. Search for, and add, exercises
2. Weight
  Record your weight. A message at the top will let you know if you need to weigh in for the day. ou can also upload progress pics, with options for Left, Right, and Front on
3. Steps
  Select a date and the steps walked then. Message up the top will tell you when you last checked in, so you know when to update from
4. Stretching
  The page will generate 3 random stretches for the main 4 groups (Arms, Legs, Back, Torso) on page load. Clicking the name will bring up a modal with a video with instructions
5. Rewards
  To help incentivise workouts, reading, finishing games, and general goal achievements, some activities will add to your earned rewards.
